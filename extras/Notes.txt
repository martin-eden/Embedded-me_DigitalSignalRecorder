/*
  Design history/thoughts

  Original concept of signal recorder and player was implemented before
  2024 when I've just used "libraries" directory for development.
  Now that repo is called "Scrapyard" and not maintained.

  I've reimplemented it 2025-03.

  In 2025-09 I want separate classes for recorder and player.
  Ideally they should not use internal array, they should write
  and read from stream.

  But our signals are too short to spend time on their transmission
  and receiving.

  So internally they will keep their array for fast write and read.
  But external interface will become stream.
